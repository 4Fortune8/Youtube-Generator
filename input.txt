GLaDOS (narrator):  Welcome, subjects, to another thrilling exploration of the anomalous. Today, we delve into the mysterious SCP-003, also known as The Organic Computer. 

[Transition to a still image of SCP-003 in its containment chamber]
:

GLaDOS: SCP-003 is classified as Euclid. It is housed in a specialized containment area, where it must be kept at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C, ideally above 100°C. No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity are permitted contact with SCP-003. Should a power failure occur, personnel must engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1, using their body heat to maintain critical temperature.

[Show image of personnel examining SCP-003]

GLaDOS: Personnel protocols are rigorous. Before entering SCP-003's containment area, personnel must be examined for body parasites and sterilized if necessary. Those who come into contact with SCP-003-1 must report for sterilization immediately. SCP-003-1 must remain affixed to SCP-003-2 unless in an emergency. Any significant change in SCP-003-2's rune activity must be reported within three hours.

GLaDOS: SCP-003 comprises two components  SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2. SCP-003-1 resembles a computer motherboard made of chitin, hair, and nails of unknown biological origin, predating modern circuit boards by millennia. SCP-003-2, a stone tablet with flickering runes, appears to control SCP-003-1. SCP-003-2's internal computer and anomalous power source are mostly inaccessible without risking damage.

[Zoom in on the flickering runes of SCP-003-2]

GLaDOS: SCP-003-2 emits controlled radiation, including heat and light, to inhibit or reverse SCP-003-1's growth. It is believed that SCP-003-2 was created to contain SCP-003-1, possibly to prevent an LK-class restructuring event. SCP-003 was discovered via remote viewing by team SRV-04 Beta, who may have been contacted by SCP-003-2 itself.

[Show text: "Reactions and Growth Stages"]

GLaDOS: When SCP-003 drops below 35°C, both components react. SCP-003-1 enters a growth state, increasing in mass and converting surrounding matter, including atmospheric elements and biological materials. In its first stage, SCP-003-1 grows into a 15-meter-diameter brittle star-like form with sensory organs. It partially converts its environment to an anomalous substance, sparing SCP-003-2.

GLaDOS: In its second stage, SCP-003-1 templates itself off living organic material, attempting communication with similar organisms. This stage sees SCP-003-1’s growth rate diminish significantly, devoting processing power to analyzing living material.

GLaDOS: Test Log 003-Alpha , SCP-003-1’s growth was halted by radiation bursts from SCP-003-2 when the temperature was restored above 100°C. Growth continued for 9 minutes and 6 seconds, followed by a radiation spike causing SCP-003-1 to revert to normal, with new growth dissolving into residue.

GLaDOS: Test Log 003-Beta, Repeated procedures led to SCP-003-1 doubling its mass and breaching containment, forming a 3-meter-tall humanoid with tentacles. Upon contact with personnel, SCP-003-1 attempted communication, inducing psychological trauma but no physical harm. Agent Jackson restored power, returning SCP-003-1 to its normal state.

[Show text: "Incident and Analysis"]

GLaDOS: During an incident, SCP-003-1 communicated telepathically, showing Dr. Moose and others vivid, indescribable images. SCP-003-1’s intent seemed to be understanding humans, suggesting a potential to remake the world into an alien version of paradise.

[Interview Transcript Excerpt 35A]

GLaDOS: Excerpt from Incident Report A21-B Cycle 8. Dr. Tilda David Moose reported. "She tried to talk to us. We heard her voice in our heads, a half-language we couldn't understand. She showed Jones a replay of his life, ripped researchers apart and put them back together, trying to understand human emotion and pain."

GLaDOS: Dr. Moose continues,  "She wants to remake the world into a paradise, but filtered through her alien understanding. If she breaches again, we must be there first to prevent disaster."

GLaDOS: Test Proposal 003-Delta. Telepathic Resonance Testing

GLaDOS: Objective. To determine the extent of SCP-003-1's telepathic abilities and its capacity for communication with humans and other organisms.

GLaDOS: Procedure. Subjects will be placed in close proximity to SCP-003-1 during its second growth stage. Using advanced telepathic resonance equipment, we will attempt to capture and decode any telepathic signals emitted by SCP-003-1. Additionally, subjects will be monitored for any psychological or physiological changes during and after exposure.

[Display image of telepathic resonance equipment]

GLaDOS: Hypothesis . SCP-003-1 may possess the ability to project complex thoughts and images into the minds of nearby organisms. Decoding these signals could provide insight into its intentions and understanding of human cognition.

GLaDOS: Test Proposal 003-Epsilon . Environmental Stress Testing

GLaDOS: Objective.  To observe SCP-003-1's growth and adaptation in response to varying environmental conditions.

GLaDOS: Procedure. SCP-003-1 will be subjected to controlled changes in temperature, humidity, and atmospheric composition. Observations will focus on its growth patterns, material conversion processes, and any alterations in its second growth stage behavior.

GLaDOS: Hypothesis.  SCP-003-1's growth and adaptation may reveal its environmental preferences and potential vulnerabilities. Understanding these factors could improve containment protocols and suggest methods for safely interacting with the entity.

GLaDOS: Test Proposal 003-Zeta. Cross-Anomaly Interaction Testing

GLaDOS: Objective. To explore potential interactions and connections between SCP-003 and other anomalies.

GLaDOS: Procedure.  SCP-003-1 will be exposed to controlled interactions with select SCP objects, such as SCP-REDACTED, SCP-1512, and SCP-2756. Observations will focus on any changes in SCP-003-1's behavior, growth, and telepathic activity during these interactions.

GLaDOS: Hypothesis.  SCP-003-1 may share characteristics or connections with other anomalies. Identifying these links could provide crucial insights into the nature of SCP-003 and its place within the broader anomalous ecosystem.




GLaDOS: Test Proposal 003-Theta.  Sentience and Cognitive Mapping

GLaDOS: Objective.  To map SCP-003-1's cognitive processes and determine the extent of its sentience.

GLaDOS: Procedure.  Advanced neuroimaging equipment will be used to monitor SCP-003-1's activity during its growth stages. Cognitive mapping algorithms will analyze the data to identify patterns indicative of sentient thought processes.

[Display image of neuroimaging equipment]

GLaDOS: Hypothesis. SCP-003-1's behavior suggests a level of sentience that may be mapped and understood. Unlocking its cognitive processes could provide unprecedented insights into its motivations and long-term objectives.



GLaDOS: Test Proposal 003-Iota. Enhanced Communication Attempts

GLaDOS: Objective. To establish direct communication with SCP-003-1 using a variety of methods.

GLaDOS: Procedure.  Researchers will employ a combination of advanced linguistics, telepathic resonance, and artificial intelligence to attempt direct communication with SCP-003-1. Subjects trained in resisting psychic influence will participate to mitigate psychological risks.


GLaDOS: Hypothesis.  SCP-003-1's attempts at communication suggest it seeks to understand and perhaps interact with humans. Establishing direct communication could pave the way for cooperative research and safer containment protocols.
