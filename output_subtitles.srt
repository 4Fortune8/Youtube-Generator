00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,697
Welcome

2
00:00:00,697 --> 00:00:01,706
test subjects

3
00:00:01,706 --> 00:00:04,621
to another exploration of the anomalous

4
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:05,248
Today

5
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:07,164
we delve into SCP-008

6
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:09,637
also known as the "Zombie Plague"

7
00:00:09,637 --> 00:00:12,621
SCP-008 is classified as Euclid

8
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:16,719
This complex prion is a Class V extreme biological hazard

9
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,552
stored in highly secure G2 sites

10
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,002
The containment protocols are stringent

11
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:26,960
ensuring incineration and irradiation measures are ready in case of any breach

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,558
The quarantine period for operatives leaving the facility is four months

13
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:33,091
In the event of a breach

14
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:37,909
all measures must be deployed to ensure the prion does not escape containment

15
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,797
Evacuation is not an option; complete eradication is the only policy

16
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:46,025
SCP-008 exhibits terrifying traits

17
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:47,674
100% infectiousness

18
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:49,183
100% lethality

19
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:53,456
and transmission through all bodily fluids and mucous membranes

20
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:54,095
However

21
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,614
it is not airborne or waterborne

22
00:00:56,614 --> 00:00:58,994
Symptoms manifest within three hours

23
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:02,198
starting with flu-like symptoms and severe dementia

24
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:05,333
leading to coma and death within 20 hours

25
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,260
Test Log 008-Alpha

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,486
Initial tests on infected subjects revealed rapid onset of symptoms

27
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,657
with subjects exhibiting high fever

28
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,992
severe dementia

29
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,873
and eventual coma

30
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:19,984
Necrotic tissue displayed remarkable resilience

31
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:23,421
functioning despite extensive cellular damage

32
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,383
Test Log 008-Beta

33
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:30,120
Infected tissue samples showed increased oxygen storage in red blood cells

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,951
leading to slower blood flow and enhanced muscle endurance

35
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:36,122
Even after total organ failure

36
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:40,000
the nervous and muscular systems remained active for hours

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,821
Infected subjects exhibit erratic behavior

38
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,108
driven by basic instincts

39
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,395
They energetically move towards sights

40
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:48,092
sounds

41
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:50,739
and smells associated with living humans

42
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:53,700
attempting to ingest them upon contact

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,240
Neutralizing these subjects requires significant cranial trauma

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,736
Test Proposal 008-Gamma

45
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:03,081
Long-Term Survival Analysis

46
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,660
Hypothesis

47
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,478
SCP-008 infected subjects can survive for over ten years without nutrition

48
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:12,891
thanks to their drastically reduced metabolism

49
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:19,532
Understanding these mechanisms could provide insights into extending human survival in extreme conditions

50
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:22,051
Test Proposal 008-Delta

51
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:23,990
Behavioral Conditioning

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,569
Hypothesis

53
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,891
Despite severe cognitive damage

54
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:33,278
SCP-008 infected subjects may retain some capacity for conditioned behavior

55
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:39,060
This could lead to methods for controlling or redirecting their actions in containment scenarios

56
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,777
Test Proposal 008-Epsilon

57
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,797
Cross-Species Infection

58
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,376
Hypothesis

59
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,786
Cross-species analysis could reveal key differences in susceptibility and symptom progression

60
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:56,730
providing valuable data for understanding SCP-008's origins and potential weaknesses

61
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,506
Addendum 008-1

62
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:00,108
SCP-500

63
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,813
known for its remarkable healing properties

64
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:07,608
has been found to completely cure SCP-008 even in advanced stages

65
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:12,577
This discovery opens new avenues for treatment and containment strategies

66
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:16,315
The pursuit of understanding SCP-008 continues

67
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:18,382
Through rigorous experimentation

68
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:22,713
we aim to harness its potential and ensure its safe application

69
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:24,466
The science must continue

70
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,266
no matter the cost

71
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:29,691
Thank you for joining us in this journey of discovery
